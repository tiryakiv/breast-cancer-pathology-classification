The codes presented in this page belong to my paper entitled "Deep Transfer Learning to Classify Mass and Calcification Pathologies from Screen Film Mammograms". I have investigated the transfer learning methods for five-way classification of breast cancer pathology patches. The mammogram patches were obtained from CBIS-DDSM and DDSM datasets. The paper can be accessed from the following link: https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/bitlisfen/issue/76292/1190134
